  author={Phan, P. T.},
  abstract={Upon a request for a preliminary ruling on the articulation between Article 13 of the European Insolvency Regulation nÂ° 1346/2000 and Article 12(1)(b) of Rome I Regulation, the Court of Justice of European Union has confirmed in a decision on April 22, 2021 that a payment made in the performance of a contract by a third party is subject to the law applicable to that contract and not to the law of the Member State opening the insolvency proceedings where the payment is challenged by an avoidance action . The decision raises some reflections on the correlation between the European Insolvency and Rome I Regulations as well as the effectiveness of avoidance action in insolvency proceedings.},

  title={Jurisdiction Over Non-EU Defendants: Should the Brussels Ia Regulation be Extended?},
  author={Saunier, B. and Phan, P. T.},
  abstract={The French law of international jurisdiction as such has never caught the attention of the French legislator. Lacking a specific code or statute on the matter, and although there is now a recent draft for a French code of private international law, of which references will be made throughout this report, sources for jurisdictional rules in the French system are very diverse. Some have been adopted through legislation, some have been developed by case-law. Because of their practical significance and mixed origins, jurisdictional rules based on the extension of internal rules of venue deserve a separate mention.},
